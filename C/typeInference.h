 * with all free type variables instantiated at ONE, and set '*type_dag' to this allocation.
 * and update the .typeAnnotation array within each node of the 'dag' to refer to their type within the resulting type DAG.
 * and set '*sourceIx' and '*targetIx' such that 'type_dag[*sourceIx]' and 'type_dag[*targetIx]' are the inferred types of the
 * Simplicity expression.
 *
 * Recall that a well-formed type DAG is always non-empty because the first element of the array is guaranteed to be the type 'ONE'.
 * If the expression is a Simplicity program then '*sourceIx' and '*targetIx' will be set to the index 0.
 *
 * If malloc fails, return 'false', otherwise return 'true'.
 * If the Simplicity DAG, 'dag', has no principal type (because it has a type error), then '*type_dag' is set to NULL and

 * Postcondition: if the return value is 'true'
 *                then either NULL == '*type_dag'
 *                     or 'dag' is well-typed with '*type_dag' and without witness values
